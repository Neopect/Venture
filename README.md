# Venture

Venture is a little game that you play in terminal. You play as the hero trying to reach the goal. You travel through the map built upon nested lists layed out in a grid based view.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    -  `functions`: the folder holding the backend related work
    - `resources`: the folder holding any resources or config files for the project
    - `views`: the folder that helps process what you see and working with the map/board
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
